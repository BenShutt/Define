# Define

An iOS app used to search for the definitions of words and save them for later.
It may be used while, say, reading to learn/remember new words. 

## Dictionary API

The API that provides the definitons of words is the (free) [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/).

## Oxford Dictionary API

The project previously used the [Oxford Languages API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/).
It was removed due to usage limitations. 
Also, an API key and thus `dictionary-api-key.json` JSON file is no longer needed which simplifies things.
